# DataScience-QuickRef

This repository features a collection of Jupyter notebooks that serve as cheat sheets for popular Python libraries used in data science, including Numpy and Pandas. Each notebook provides a concise and practical reference to help users quickly understand and apply key functionalities of these libraries.

## Notebooks

### 1. Numpy Quick Reference
- **Description**: This notebook provides a quick reference to various [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) commands and functionalities.
- **File**: `Numpy_QuickRef.ipynb`

### 2. Pandas Quick Reference
- **Description**: This notebook offers a concise guide to using [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data manipulation and analysis.
- **File**: `Pandas_QuickRef.ipynb`

## Future Work
- **TensorFlow Quick Reference**: A notebook providing a quick reference to the basics of TensorFlow and its applications in machine learning and deep learning.

## Original Documentation

While these notebooks provide a quick reference, it's important to consult the official documentation for comprehensive information:

- [Numpy Documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/)
- [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)

Referring to the original documentation will help you gain a deeper understanding of the libraries and stay updated with the latest features and best practices.
